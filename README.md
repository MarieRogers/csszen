This project focused on the ability of CSS to alter the experience of a webpage. The two example webpages use the same HTML but vary in the application of CSS.

I wanted to focus on the way to lay out a webpage for this project. For Example 1 I worked with margins to create different levels of text, and I also played around with borders and the different ways to align my navbar. For Example 2, I wanted to keep elements of the page fixed, so I had to work with the margins and spacing in order to prevent overlap of the different elements of the page while maintaining the navbar and header on the left side of the page.

I used w3schools and css-tricks.com to look up certain functions of CSS, and I did not consult with anyone else.
